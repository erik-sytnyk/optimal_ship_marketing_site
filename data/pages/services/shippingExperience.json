    "quote": "“My experience with OptimalShip is always pleasant, efficient, helpful, and productive. I too am in the customer service field, and I can say that my customer experience with OptimalShip is always fantastic, especially when I’m being helped by Sarah. All of your representatives are always so very helpful and go the extra mile for me, but Sarah really takes assisting me to another level by surely going above and beyond the call of duty to get the job done, as well as following up with me to ensure that everything was copasetic. In short, the customer service industry would be much better if there were more reps everywhere like the ones that work at OptimalShip because you can actually tell that they genuinely care.”",
