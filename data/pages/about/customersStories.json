      "description": "Clearing customs can be the most frustrating and expensive step in shipping internationally. If you don’t have much experience in customs brokerage, common mistakes in the document preparation process could add days to your shipment transit time. With improper documentation, you or your customers could also pay extra duties and taxes and holding fees, just so the shipment will be allowed to leave the airport. Choosing DHL Express allows you to rest easy, knowing that the customs brokerage is going to be handled properly.",

      "description": "When a shipment crosses an international border, it goes through the customs clearance process where the country’s import laws are enforced, and duties and taxes are assessed. There are two types of invoices that can be created for an international shipment, and this article will guide you through which one you need to make. Some shipments are obviously commercial since they are being formally purchased from another country and will be subject to duty and tax. Others have nominal value or are not for resale, regardless of their value; these shipments might not be subject to duty and tax. The biggest role that an invoice plays in customs is to aid customs agents in enforcing duty and tax laws.",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered how a package travels from one end of the world to the other? Well, obviously something gets sent usually by plane or ocean, but there are several variables that can make this process seem a little confusing. The distance alone is one of the largest factors. Then there’s the relationships different nations have with the rest of the world. Sometimes it’s positive…other times, not so much. Even countries usually open to trade have different laws with various products. As an example, one person in the U.S. shipping a computer to someone else in the U.S. likely won’t cause any issues. But, try making that same shipment to India, and you’ll find yourself with a world of problems if you weren’t prepared with what you needed to make the shipment.",
