I have gained better confidence in holding phone conversations especially on how to talk proficiently in a business manner. I have been better equipped on how to listen, overcome objections, and finding solutions for problems. I have been grateful for the flexible schedule that can work great around classes. It is focused work, so you go in and do your job, which I prefer not having to worrying about the stress of having to take over someone elseâ€™s workload. I have enjoyed my time working here!",
