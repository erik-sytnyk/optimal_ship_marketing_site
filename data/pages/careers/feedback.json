I have gained better confidence in holding phone conversations, especially on how to speak proficiently in a business manner. I have been better equipped on how to listen, overcome objections, and find solutions to problems. I have been grateful for the flexible schedule that can work great around classes. It is focused work, so you go in and do your job without having to worry about the stress of having to take over someone else’s workload. I have enjoyed my time working here!”",
